% purge2.m

% Purges the workspace of all variables, classes, timers, etc.

close all 

% close all executes the 'CloseRequestFunction' of every window that has a
% visible handle.

% This order is important because it deletes any open windows that have a
% visible handle, before deleting the reference to the objects that created
% the windows. If you call clear first, you delete reference to the object
% that created the open window but the open window stays open and now you
% have a window that points to nothing which crashes MATLAB when you try to
% interact with the window.

% Whenever you run clear on a class instance, it calls the destructor (if
% defined) BUT only when there are no outstanding references to the object
% (like open windows, etc).  To define a destructor, define a delete()
% method in the class

% Loop through workspace variables and call delete on each one that is an
% object.

% You may be tempted to make a class or a method of Utils that executes
% this code but it will not work.  The problem is that "who" only has
% access to the variables within scope of where it is called from.  If it
% is called from within a class method, it only has access to the class
% variables.
